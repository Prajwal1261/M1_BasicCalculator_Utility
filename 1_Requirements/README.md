## Introduction
A calculator is a device which is capable of performing certain arthmetic tasks and allows people to do math operations more easily.Some of the basic mathematical operations it performs are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and many other operations as well.Calculators provide operations for user to select one at a time.So calculator making computations much quicker and more exact which reduces time in solving complex problems.

## High level requirements
- Display the contents of operations for the user.
- Should be able to select the opertions of users choice.
- Giving out the correct result.

## Low level requirements
- Using switch case to select the required operation for user.
- Using functions for each operations to perform.

## SWOT Analysis
1.Strength
- calculator helps to solve complicated problems quickly and in efficient manner.
- calculators are user friendly and long lasting.

2.Weakness
- All operations are not available.
- It is restricted to certain constraints where some operations take only float values and some take integer values.

3.Opportunities
- It has lot of oppurtunities in tech-based market.

4.Threats
- Slower growth in technological innovation will bring significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
