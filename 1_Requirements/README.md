## Introduction
A calculator is a device which is capable of performing certain arthmetic tasks and allows people to do math operations more easily.Some of the basic mathematical operations it performs are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and many other operations as well.Calculators provide operations for user to select one at a time.So calculator making computations much quicker and more exact which reduces time in solving complex problems.
