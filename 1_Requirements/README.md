## Introduction
A Calculator is a device which is capable of performing certain arithmetic tasks and allows people to do math operations more easily. Some of the basic mathematical operations it performs are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and many other operations as well. Calculators provide operations for user to select one at a time. So calculator making computations much quicker and more exact which reduces time in solving complex problems.

In this project along with simple operations additional operations like factorial, Power, modulus, square and cube of a number is performed.
